      "AIducate is an AI-powered education platform developed as part of my undergraduate dissertation to address the limitations of passive recorded lectures in blended learning environments. The system embeds pedagogical guidance directly into the content creation workflow by automating slide generation, intelligently inserting context-aware interactive activities, and compiling materials into interactive, voice-narrated video lessons. By reducing the time, technical, and instructional barriers to active learning, AIducate makes interactive teaching practices more accessible and sustainable for educators.",
